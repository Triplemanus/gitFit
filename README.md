# GitFit

## Overview

The goals of this project included:
* Utilizing ES6 classes to create instances of the class to be able to call methods upon them and display data on the DOM while communicating between themselves as necessary.
* Implementing strong TDD principles utilizing the Mocha testing framework and Chai assertion library to build out and test our application.
* Using array prototype methods to manipulate multiple data files.
* Deploy an NPM package (Charts.js in this case) to display data on the DOM.
